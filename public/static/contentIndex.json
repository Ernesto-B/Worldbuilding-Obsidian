The city exists in stark contrast to the grandeur of its aerial counterpart, thriving instead on the second-hand benefits of cascadea’s trade and wealth. Its streets are alive with the sounds of haggling merchants, clanging forges, and whispered dealings, all while a shadow of disorganization and lawlessness looms over much of its populace.\nStonefall is divided into five distinct sections, called Hollows, each carved into the crater’s sheer walls and organized by elevation. These Hollows represent not only the physical layout of the city but also the socioeconomic hierarchy of its people. Each Hollow is separated by massive metal grates, reinforced with thick steel beams, and platform elevators, which serve as the primary means of vertical travel. While higher Hollows are more regulated and secure, the lower Hollows devolve into chaos and lawlessness, thus creating a survival-of-the-fittest mentality.\nBeastfolk in Stonefall: Beastfolk dominate physically demanding roles in the Ember Ring and Dimming Mire, such as laborers, guards, and miners. Their enhanced senses also make them excellent trackers, often hired by the black-basin-syndicate for smuggling and enforcement. In the Black Depths, beastfolk fighters often hold dominance in the Pit of Despair, their raw strength making them favorites in the brutal underground battles. However, they are often exploited by humans running the arena.\nHumans in Stonefall: Humans occupy roles requiring cunning and magical prowess, such as merchants, alchemists, and minor enchanters in the Azure Steps. The Sunlit Crown is predominantly human, as their affinity for magic and wealth accumulation secures them positions of influence in the Iyresan government.\n\nLocation\n\nThe city is formed on the natural ridges that were formed from the meteor impact.\n\nPlot\n\n\n\nKey Locations\n\nThe Sunlit Crown (First hollow):\n\nPerched at the top of the crater, the Sunlit Crown enjoys the rare blessing of full sunlight. This district is home to Stonefall’s wealthiest citizens, influential merchants, and members of the Council of Hollows, who govern the city with varying degrees of corruption.\nStreets are lined with well-maintained stone buildings adorned with ornate carvings and magical lanterns. Lavish markets sell high-quality goods imported from Cascadea, though they come at exorbitant prices.\nGuard presence is strong, and only those with proper documentation or bribes can ascend to this Hollow.\n\n\nThe Azure Steps (Second hollow):\n\nA bustling middle-class district, where skilled artisans, tradespeople, and merchants ply their crafts. This Hollow is named for the Azure Aqueducts, a network of enchanted water channels that wind through the streets, delivering fresh water to the upper Hollows.\nThe air is thick with the scent of forges, workshops, and food stalls, as residents work tirelessly to cater to the demands of the wealthier layers. While relatively safe, the Azure Steps still struggle with occasional thefts and disputes.\n\n\nThe Ember Ring (Third hollow):\n\nThe lifeblood of Stonefall, where laborers, miners, and adventurers reside. This district rings the crater like a glowing band, with forges and smelters constantly churning out tools, weapons, and armor for trade.\nDespite its utility, the Ember Ring is rough and rowdy, with crime syndicates and mercenary gangs occasionally clashing in the streets. The black-basin-syndicate exerts significant influence here, running a smuggling operation through secret tunnels and the lower platform elevators.\n\n\nThe Dimming Mire (Fourth hollow):\n\nThe first of the truly impoverished districts, where homes are little more than shanties stacked precariously against the crater’s walls. The dim, damp environment is illuminated only by bioluminescent fungi cultivated by desperate residents for both light and food.\nThe Dimming Mire is infamous for its Rot Bazaar, a sprawling black market where anything can be bought or sold—be it illegal goods, monster and human parts, or forbidden magic. The Syndicate maintains a dominant presence here, ensuring their operations thrive without interference.\nDisease and despair are common, and most residents are either too poor to leave or unwilling to risk the dangers of moving to the Black Depths below.\n\n\nThe Black Depths (Fifth hollow):\n\nThe lowest and most dangerous part of Stonefall, where sunlight never reaches and the air is damp and stifling. The Black Depths are a chaotic sprawl of dilapidated structures, forgotten tunnels, and gang hideouts.\nHere lies the Pit of Despair, an infamous underground fighting ring operated by the black-basin-syndicate. Fighters from all Hollows come to prove their strength or die trying, while spectators gamble their last coins, and food scraps when no coin can be found.\nRumors persist of ancient ruins and dangerous monsters lurking in the deepest parts of the crater, though few who venture into these areas return to tell the tale.\n\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nAdventuring Hooks\n\nSyndicate Secrets: The black-basin-syndicate is rumored to control hidden tunnels connecting all five Hollows, using them for smuggling and covert operations. These tunnels are fiercely guarded, and adventurers who stumble upon them often disappear.\nThe Collapsing Depths: Whispers circulate that the Black Depths are unstable, and a catastrophic collapse could threaten the entire city. The Iyresan government refuses to acknowledge the danger.\nThe Forgotten Crater: Deep in the Black Depths, fragments of an ancient civilization’s ruins hint at Stonefall’s origins, but few have explored them due to the dangers lurking in the dark.\n"},"mechanics/character-options/index":{"slug":"mechanics/character-options/index","filePath":"mechanics/character-options/index.md","title":"Character Options — Homebrew","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Player-facing ancestries, classes, and backgrounds for this world.\n\nTODO: Add specific options here.\n"},"mechanics/index":{"slug":"mechanics/index","filePath":"mechanics/index.md","title":"Mechanics — Homebrew Options","links":["mechanics/spells/spells","mechanics/items/","mechanics/character-options/"],"tags":[],"content":"Player-facing options and tables.\n\nSpells index.\nItems and gear.\nCharacter Options.\n"},"mechanics/items/index":{"slug":"mechanics/items/index","filePath":"mechanics/items/index.md","title":"Items — Homebrew Gear","links":["assets/items/item-airship.png"],"tags":[],"content":"Unique equipment, artifacts, and notable gear.\n\nAirship art.\n"},"mechanics/spells/spells":{"slug":"mechanics/spells/spells","filePath":"mechanics/spells/spells.md","title":"Spells","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Spells will be documented here."},"peoples/beastfolk":{"slug":"peoples/beastfolk","filePath":"peoples/beastfolk.md","title":"Beastfolk","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Summary\n\nNative to Iyresa?\nThe Beast People specialize in hunting and combat.

Each Pillar is tied to an essential element of the Isles’ survival—Sea, Sky, and Stone—and is worshipped through distinct practices and rituals. Each island in the archipelago has a temple to one of these deities, emphasizing their respective contributions to survival:\n\nOn kaelyth-island: Sky Pillar, the “Bringer of Winds”\nOn vorynth-island: Sea Pillar, the “Keeper of Depths”\nOn dremscar-island: Stone Pillar, the “Eternal Foundation”\n\nThe Sky Pillar - Kaelyth Island\n\nThe Sky Pillar embodies freedom, innovation, and protection. It is believed to guide the winds, crucial for airships, gliders, and crop growth on sky farms.\nSymbol: A spiral of winds encircling a radiant sun.\nTemple of Winds: Located on Kaelyth Island, this temple stands atop the island’s natural highest point. Its architecture includes spires designed to catch and amplify the wind’s song, creating a melodic hum throughout the temple. Floatstone sculptures of birds and clouds decorate the temple, and wind chimes hang from every corner.\nSkyward Blessing: Sky farmers, airship pilots, and the Sky Guard undergo a blessing ritual before their journeys. They light incense that creates colorful smoke trails, symbolizing the winds’ guidance.\nCall of the Winds: At dawn, worshippers gather to release small, floatstone-powered kites carrying prayers and wishes into the skies.\n\nThe Sea Pillar\n\nThe Sea Pillar governs the oceans surrounding the Isles, symbolizing the mysteries of the deep, adaptability, and resilience. It is seen as a dual force: a provider (offering fish and trade routes) and a destroyer (unleashing deadly monsters and storms).\nSymbol: A spiraling wave encircling a single eye, representing the all-seeing depths.\nTemple of the Depths: Located on vorynth-island, the temple is built partially underwater. Its main chamber is a vast, dome-like structure with glass panels offering views of the ocean depths.\n\n\nVisitors offer shells, salt, and miniature floatstone carvings to honor the sea’s bounty and protection.\nDrowning of Fears: Participants write their fears or sins on palm leaves and release them into the water during ceremonies. If the offering is accepted (it sinks quickly), the Sea Pillar has forgiven them.\nStorm’s Trial: An annual event where aspiring sailors or adventurers brave a treacherous stretch of sea to prove their worth to the Keeper of Depths.\n\nThe Stone Pillar - Skystead\n\nThe Stone Pillar represents stability, endurance, and knowledge. It is the protector of the floatstone fields and the physical and spiritual foundation of the Isles.\n\n\nSymbol: A triangular mountain split in the center, revealing a glowing crystal core.\nTemple of the Foundation: Located in Skystead on Dremscar Island, the temple is a monumental structure carved into the island’s cliffs. Its central chamber holds a massive chunk of unpurified floatstone, believed to be a fragment of the Pillar itself. The temple features intricate carvings detailing the history of the Aetheris Isles, passed down through generations.\nStonekeeper’s Vigil: Worshippers meditate in silence within the temple, touching the sacred floatstone. It is said to grant visions or insights into the future.\nThe Unyielding March: Islanders carry heavy stones up the cliffs to the temple as an act of penance or devotion, symbolizing their willingness to endure hardship.\nFoundation’s Renewal: Once a year, a ceremonial purification of floatstone occurs at the temple. The process is kept secret, and only the most trusted scholars and clergy are allowed to participate.\n"},"rules/index":{"slug":"rules/index","filePath":"rules/index.md","title":"Rules — Table Standards","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Table standards in play at the table.\nCore Table Rules\n\nUndos: you can change or retract anything your characters do up until the point they learn of the consequences.

The largest cities in Iyresa are cascadea and stonefall.\nCascadea sits atop a gigantic floating landmass that was suspended in the air 62,000 years ago for some unknown reason. While Cascadea is widely regarded as being the undisputed king of entertainment and pleasure cities, as well as hosting the one of the most luxurious auction facilities in the world, it is no exaggeration to say only the wealthiest of the wealthy and high-profile merchants or adventurers can hope to stay.\nThe city of Cascadea was built slightly above the surface of a shallow lake on the floating landmass, and is densely constructed with East-asian (china/japan) architecture, with plenty of orange lanterns, tatami, sliding doors, pagoda-style roofing, and small arching bridges to cross between the lake’s water channels. Navigation through the city is done through either walking or via East-Asian canoe/boat. The city is split into 5 different districts, called Drifts. As the center of the lake is a pit where the water from the lake falls into, the city itself was built starting on the edges of the lake, leaving about a 500m space from the pit.\nOn the other hand, the city of Stonefall, which sits in the crater left behind by the violent dislodging of the floating landmass, enjoys only the second-hand benefits of Cascadea: medium quality goods and services, as well as more crime and disorganization. Split into 5 different sections of the city (denoted by elevation) called Hollows, the higher Hollows enjoy sunlight and more organization and regulations, while lower hollows devolve into a survival of the fittest and chaotic livelihood with black markets and unethical or illegal activities. The different hollows are separated by (something??), and entrances from one Hollow to another are heavily guarded. The only way to move from one Hollow to another is via (something??).\nTo enter the country, there are pathways coming from the cindral-mountains in the southwest, as well as port-phyrella: one of the largest sea ports for ships coming in from anywhere in the Black Tides.\nBetween the main cities and the mountains, Iyresa is made up of abundant plains which are home to B-D rank monsters.\nTo the west, in the cindral-mountains, there are numerous caves which are host to both precious ores and ferocious beasts.\nDue to the central and highly visited nature of Iyresa, many festivals take place in the region, in celebration of the mosaic of cultures and peoples.\niyresan-bay: an underwater plateau of shallow depth which was home to beastfolk cities and towns of ages past destroyed in wars. The bay is home to a myriad of fish who make their homes in the illuminated waters.\n\nGeographical Location and Features\n\nSouthwest of the index, across the Black Tides.\n\nLore\nOther Key Locations\n\nonyx-caves\nport-phyrella\niyresan-plains\nbaytown\ncascadea\nstonefall\ncindral-mountains\niyresan-bay\nIsland Shrine\n\nHistory\n\nIyresa was originally home to the beastfolk, who inhabited every inch of land east of the cindral-mountains.\n62,000 years ago, a meteor hit the northern part of the land, sending the beastfolk southeast towards the forest.\nThe meteor blast shot out floatstone which landed in the index, alerting the inhabiting humans of the the power the stone had. As a result of the new discovery and power of the stone, the humans ventured down across Black Tides to see the aftermath of the blast to see if the could salvage even more magical materials.\n==Upon arrival, humans imitated powers from the stone and learned/evolved their own magic. Some people from the index saw these new magical phenomena as blasphemous as it went against their religion, and others wanted to keep exploring these abilities and make it apart of their day-to-day lives; hence, this created a new population of humans in the north of the continent, whereas the non-believers travelled back to the isles.==\nEventually, the beastfolk returned to rebuild civilization but were faced with foreign humans from the index, resulting in tensions which led to a territorial dispute.\nThis dispute was violent, as the beastfolk were abundant in number. However, the humans had managed to hone their magical abilities enough to be able to fend off a large amount of opponents with both defensive and offensive spellcasting.\nA shrine was built southeast of the crater on an island. This shrine was meant for beastfolk to come and pray when their loved ones were out fighting.\nThe humans, knowing they were outnumbered, and the beastfolk, knowing they could not match the humans’ offensive powers, eventually decided to call a ceasefire. This ceasefire lasted for a year before coming back together and declaring a truce, where both beings could co-exist.\nTo this day, the truce remains and the beings co-exist peacefully with each other.\n\n\n\nThe Floating Landmass and Cascadea&#039;s Origin: The floating landmass that houses Cascadea is believed to have been suspended 62,000 years ago by an ancient and forgotten civilization. Legends suggest it was the result of a cataclysmic battle between two powerful deities, one seeking to destroy the world and another protecting it. The pit in the center of Cascadea&#039;s lake is rumored to be a remnant of the god&#039;s spear strike. Fragments of this civilization&#039;s arcane glyphs can still be found in Cascadea&#039;s undercity, which remains largely unexplored.\nStonefall’s Struggles: The crater left by the landmass’s dislodging gave rise to Stonefall, a city built from the ruins of the original settlement. Its earliest inhabitants were refugees and survivors of the cataclysm, struggling to adapt to a hostile environment. The city eventually became a haven for outlaws, mercenaries, and traders seeking to profit from Cascadea’s splendor, leading to its current fractured society.\n\nDetailed Notes\nGovernment Structure\n\nThe coast is a democratically run nation with a chair made up of 10 people. Of the 10, 5 come from cascadea, where each candidate is from a different drift, and 5 from stonefall, where each candidate is from a separate hollow.\nDue of the diversity of the chair, internal conflict arises because of opposing interests and goals.\nInternal conflicts leads to negligence in both cities, which results in crime lords arising in the lower Hollows\n\nGuilds\n\nthe-gilded-compass\nThe black-basin-syndicate\nAdventurer’s Guild\n\nSocial/Economic/Political Hierarchy (Class Structure)\n\nCascadean Elite: Wealthy merchants, adventurers, and entertainers. The rich enjoy lavish lifestyles with access to private auctions, feasts, and the best luxuries.\nStonefall Upper Hollows: Artisans, traders, and guild members benefit from proximity to Cascadea but lack its opulence.\nStonefall Lower Hollows: Laborers, petty criminals, and displaced refugees live in squalor, where survival outweighs morality.\nRural Plainsfolk: Farmers, hunters, and small-town traders. Largely self-sufficient.\n\nPolitical/Social Ideology and Culture\n\nIyresa’s society values wealth, ingenuity, and adaptability over tradition or lineage. This capitalist ethos makes it a beacon for traders and adventurers but fosters stark inequalities. Its political neutrality allows it to serve as a diplomatic meeting point for rival nations, though behind closed doors, power is wielded by the wealthy and ruthless.\n\nTrade and Economics\n\nThe main industries of the Coast is trading and tourism/traveling, and entertainment.\nOther industries include: property (especially on cascadea and the first hollow), mining, and purchases on any mosaic of magic items, runic technology and knowledge.\nExport ores, and magic tools\nport-phyrella: One of the busiest ports in the world, handling everything from massive merchant ships to smaller smuggling vessels.\nstonefall’s Black Markets: A hub for forbidden goods—stolen relics, counterfeit potions, and illicit substances.\nVery few skilled merchants use illusion spells to make their wares more appealing.\n\nLanguage and Naming\n\nStandard Iyresan\n\nReligion\n\nthe-hollow-flame\nThe Three Pillars??\n\nMagic/Alchemy\n\nIllusion\nHealing\nTool Enhancement\n\nLegal System\n\n(See cascadea and the council-of-drifts)\n\nOrganized Crime\n\nOrganized crime has risen in the lower Hollows, such as smuggling, kidnapping, drug dealing, thievery, illegal use of magical items, and manslaughter.\nThe organized crime has arisen due to tensions in the government chair, where even though stonefall has 5 representatives, no real changes are being made to make the quality of life better. Crime lords are resorting to these crimes so that they can make a living as well as protect their peers from other crime lords.\ncascadea is absent of crime on paper, however, many citizens strike deals with crime lords from stonefall to obtain illegal substances or other dangerous items.\nThe upper class of humans in cascadea, though rare, use illegal illusion magic to deceive traders or customers for personal gain. Some of these scholars of magic have made their way up into a government chair.\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nInter-racial relations\n\n\n\nMusic/Fashion/Food\n\n\n\nScience, Medicine, and Technology\n\nRunic Vehicles: Enchanted boats and carriages that use small runestones for propulsion and navigation.\nClockwork Gadgets: The artisans of stonefall craft intricate mechanical devices, such as auto-crossbows, lockpick tools, and even small automata for basic labor.\n\n\nMining Equipment: Magic-powered drills and carts used in the cindral-mountains for extracting ores.\n\nMilitary, Secret Services, Conflict\n\nThe Coast does not have a military, due to being strictly a neutral nation that is sworn not to support any side in any conflict. However, due to the disparity between the livelihood in cascadea and stonefall, it cannot be said that there are no underhand deals and decisions being made.\n\nThe Supernatural/Myths/Legends\n\nMichael Jackson\n\nArchitecture/Civic Planning\n\nDensely constructed with East-Asian (China/Japan) architecture\n\nAging &amp; Pregnancy\n\n\n\nMarriage\n\n\n\nDeath, Funerals, and the Afterlife\n\n\n\nAdventuring Hooks\n\nForbidden Depths of cascadea: The pit at Cascadea’s center is off-limits, with rumors of ancient horrors or treasures lying beneath the lake.\nHidden Caverns in thecindral-mountains: Some believe these caves house runic teleportation gates to other realms, guarded by elemental beings.\nTrade Rivalry: A wealthy Cascadean merchant hires adventurers to sabotage a rising rival in stonefall, igniting tension between the cities.\nMonsters in the iyresan-plains: Increasing monster attacks threaten Iyresa’s trade routes, hinting at a deeper disturbance in the land.\n"},"world/geography/drift":{"slug":"world/geography/drift","filePath":"world/geography/drift.md","title":"Drift","links":["locations/iyresa/cascadea"],"tags":[],"content":"Description\n\nA Drift is equivalent to a district in the city of cascadea, which is separated and enclosed by waterfalls and waterways surrounding the area.\nThere are 5 drifts, split into the entertainment, market &amp; trading, scholar, government, and energy.\n"},"world/geography/hollow":{"slug":"world/geography/hollow","filePath":"world/geography/hollow.md","title":"Hollow","links":["locations/iyresa/stonefall","world/geography/coast-of-iyresa"],"tags":[],"content":"Lore\n\nA Hollow is the equivalent of a district in the city of stonefall in the coast-of-iyresa, which are separated by different layers of the cratered city.\nThere are 5 Hollows, separated by economic class.
