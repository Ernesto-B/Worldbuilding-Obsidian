Below is an **in-world historical account**, written as if compiled by a learned **HUMAN** scholar of the Second Age.  
It is intentionally incomplete, cautious in tone, and shaped by what a well-educated reader in Miskar would be _permitted_ and _able_ to know.

## On the Dawn of the First Age
The First Age of Miskar is remembered as an era of light, order, and rising peoples. The sun and stars shone without obstruction, and the world unfolded beneath them in balance. Kingdoms rose where land was fertile, halls were carved where stone was strong, and forests were tended rather than conquered.

The peoples of Miskar spread, and lived without magic as we now know it. Steel, craft, and courage defined the age. Conflict existed, as it always has, but wars were limited in scope. Despite the peoples of Miskar being composed of so many races: humans, elves, wood elves, drow, dwarves, halflings, tieflings, goliaths, and the cursed dragonborn, no threat yet sought the unmaking of the world itself.

The heavens were revered, not merely as distant wonders, but as signs of order. The sun was life. The stars were guidance. Cloud and rain were seen as passing trials, not omens of doom.

It was in this world that the First Age found its peak.

## The Coming of the Grey
In the latter centuries of the First Age, signs of calamity appeared. At first they were subtle. Mists that lingered too long. Skies that dimmed without storm. Animals that fled familiar lands.

Then came the Grey, 2477 years after the start of the First Age.

It advanced not as a single front, but as a creeping shroud. Where it settled, light faded. Sun and stars were veiled. Sound dulled. Crops failed. Beasts grew twisted. Minds frayed.

Whole regions vanished behind fog and were never reclaimed.

From the Grey emerged horrors previously unknown. Foul creatures. Unnatural beasts. Hosts that seemed to multiply where they fell. Armies marched against them and broke, unable to strike what they could not fully see.

This era is known as the **Long Dimming** (2477–2952 FA), and it marked the true beginning of the world’s unravelling.

## The Shrouding War
As the Grey spread, the peoples of Miskar united as they never had before. Kingdoms set aside old rivalries. Councils were formed. Messengers crossed lands already half lost.

Yet steel alone proved insufficient. The Grey did not fear walls or numbers. Entire armies were swallowed by the withering fog, their banners never recovered.

In desperation, the wisest among the races gathered. Scholars, sages, priests, artificers, and elders met in what is remembered as the **Gathering of the Wise** (2520 FA). What passed in that council is not fully recorded, and much of it remains sealed or disputed.

What is known is this:

**Magic entered the world.** 

It did not arrive gently.

Those who first wielded it described it as overwhelming. Familiar, yet terrifying. As though something long absent had returned all at once. Magic illuminated the world, but it also revealed how fragile it truly was.

With magic, the peoples of Miskar could finally strike back. The Grey recoiled, if only slightly. Enchanted arms and armor spread. Spellcasters rose. Artifice and arcane craft flourished.

The Shrouding War raged for centuries.

## Thaurûn the Starless
From within the Grey emerged its master.

He is remembered as **Thaurûn the Starless**. An aasimar bearing black wings and a halo that vanished at will, he commanded the Grey with singular purpose. His presence strengthened the fog and the creatures bound to it.

At his side stood his captains.

Among them were Angoleth, the Shadow Grafter, who twisted flesh and form; Dragon Lord Vorkul the Eclipse, whose mighty wings could blot out the sun; Caelreth the Darkeater, and his retainers: the Veiled, whose true number and nature are still debated.

From his fortress, **Amon Gûl**, the Mountain of Shadows, Thaurûn directed a war of unmaking.

Despite magic, Miskar nearly fell.

## The War of Night
The final decade of the First Age is known as the **War of Night** (2952–2962 FA).

The peoples of Miskar had managed to puncture through the Grey and Thaurûn's armies before the shadow of Amon Gûl, and waged the final war upon the plains of Daedhel. 

The Grey thickened until day and night lost meaning. Battles were fought under dim skies that never cleared. Hordes poured forth from Amon Gûl without end, sometimes even swarming around the plains and attacking the weakened and undefended cities behind.

The cost was ruinous.

Cities fell. Kingdoms burned. Entire cultures were broken. Even victory, when it came, carried no triumph.

At last, a coalition of heroes, led by one chosen by the Three Great Gods, confronted Thaurûn beneath the shadow of his mountain. Legends name five, though accounts differ on their deeds and fates.

Thaurûn was struck a blow that would have unmade any lesser being. He did not perish. Gravely wounded, he withdrew into the depths of Amon Gûl. The Grey receded from the wider world, though it grew thicker still around the mountain.

The war ended not with celebration, but with silence.

It ended not because a victor was crowned, but because both sides had exhausted all recourse. 

---

## The End of the First Age
The First Age ended not with peace, but with exhaustion.

The Grey was scattered, not destroyed. Foul creatures fled into deep places and forgotten lands. Ruins remained. Scars marked the world where magic and unmaking had clashed. 

Once beautiful regions of the world were completely disintegrated under the cataclysmic dragonfire of Vorkul the Eclipse. The monumental, withering carcasses of the Titans whom fought alongside the peoples of Miskar became just that... monuments of the loss of the First Age. Great dwarven kingdoms became tombs of old kings and their runic technology. The tangled, deep cities of the drow, emptied and forgotten. 

Magic did not leave Miskar.

Its use continued, though unease grew around it. New doctrines arose. Records were gathered, revised, or sealed. Faith in the sun and stars deepened, shaped now by fear as much as reverence.

The War of Night came to be remembered not as a victory, but as judgement.

Judgement for what, scholars have never agreed.

## On Memory and Silence
Much of the First Age has been lost, not only to time, but to careful preservation. The Celestial Order maintains the most complete records, though even these are known to be curated.

Some truths survive in fragmentary form. Others linger only in songs, ruins, or whispered traditions.

No peoples in Miskar emerged unscarred.  
No peoples remember the war the same way.  
No peoples agree on what should happen next.

What is certain is this:

The First Age ended with the world intact, but changed.

The light returned, but trust did not.  
The stars still shone, but something beneath them stirred...
Be it from the people's own vices with one another, or from something more sinister; nothing is clear. 

Thus began the Second Age.
