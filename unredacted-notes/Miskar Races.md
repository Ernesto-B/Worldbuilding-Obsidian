## DRAGONBORN

### Origins and Metaphysical Status
Dragonborn are among the **first intelligent races** created in Miskar, shaped directly by the Old Gods before the Great Gods assumed control. This origin has been deliberately obscured through divine manipulation, cultural erasure, and engineered instinctual aversion in other races.

Dragonborn themselves do not consciously know their origin. However, they possess a persistent intuition that the world’s dominant cosmology is incomplete or dishonest. This manifests as:
- distrust of absolute religious authority
- resistance to celestial dogma
- heightened sensitivity to divine manipulation

This intuition is not ideological. It is biological and spiritual.

### Physical and Magical Aptitude
Dragonborn are **exceptional** by design. Even before the breaking of the Seal:
- Many dragonborn could grow wings and fly for short periods.
- Elemental breath was innate.
- Physical resilience exceeded all other races.

After magic returned:
- Dragonborn demonstrated both biological and arcane supremacy.
- They adapted to spellcasting faster than many other races.
- Their bodies could withstand magical backlash better than humans or elves.

They are not the most _skilled_ casters overall, but they are among the most **dangerous** when magic is involved.

### Values
Dragonborn culture values:
- loyalty to chosen kin over ideology
- honor proven through action, not belief
- restraint in power usage
- remembrance of sacrifice

They are slow to trust and slower to forgive betrayal.

### Role in the First Age Wars
Dragonborn contributions during the Long Dimming and War of Night were decisive:
- Rapid-response strike forces.
- Aerial suppression of Grey hosts.
- Holding remote theaters where no other race could arrive in time.

They felt the pull of the Old Gods during the conflict. Most resisted it consciously, choosing solidarity with the peoples of Miskar despite persecution.

### Post-War and Second Age Outlook
Dragonborn emerge from the First Age with:
- grudging recognition
- unspoken resentment from others
- increasing legal and cultural restrictions

Second Age discrimination intensifies due to:
- association with Vorkul the Eclipse
- fear of flight near celestial bodies
- jealousy of innate power
- refusal to submit to the Celestial Order

Dragonborn respond by retreating into isolation, selective alliances, and guarded neutrality.

They are not plotting rebellion.  
They are waiting.

## DWARVES

### Worldview and Theology
Dwarves fundamentally reject celestial primacy.

Their belief system centers on the **earth as sustainer**, not the heavens:
- stone gives shelter
- ore gives strength
- fire gives warmth
- soil gives life

Faithful dwarves exist but reinterpret celestial worship into earthbound symbolism. Bioluminescent cavern ceilings mimic the stars, not to honor them, but to domesticate them.

### Magical Aptitude
Dwarves are generally **poor direct spellcasters**.  
They excel instead in:
- rune magic
- enchantment
- artificing
- wardcraft

Dwarven magic is slow, stable, and persistent. It rarely produces dramatic effects but endures for centuries. This makes dwarven artifacts some of the most reliable magical constructs in existence.

### Values
Dwarves value:
- labor as proof of worth
- reliability over charisma
- oath-keeping above belief
- survival over reputation

They judge individuals by performance, not origin. This creates unexpected tolerance toward tieflings and others deemed suspect by elves.

### Role in the First Age Wars
Dwarves fought a **siege war from below**:
- Entire cities converted into fortresses.
- Mountains weaponized.
- Rune artillery deployed at unprecedented scale.

Some kings sealed their holds completely, prioritizing survival over compassion. Refugees were denied entry. Starvation occurred inside sealed cities.

These choices saved dwarves. They also hardened them.

### War of Night and Entrapment
Vorkul’s strategic collapse of mountain entrances trapped dwarves and drow underground. Despite willingness, dwarves could not reach Amon Gûl in force.

Simultaneously, Rivorn the Dread conducted extermination campaigns from the depths of the earth, raising fallen dwarves as Deathless.

This trauma defines dwarven memory of the war.

### Second Age Outlook
Dwarves emerge:
- embittered
- pragmatic
- distrustful of surface politics

They resent being blamed for absence they could not prevent. They maintain limited engagement with the Celestial Order, treating it as a political inconvenience rather than divine authority.

## ELVES (GENERAL)

### Cultural Identity
Elves value continuity above all else.

Their civilization is built on:
- controlled lineage
- curated history
- institutional memory
- long-term stability

Change is feared when uncontrolled, not when deliberate.

### Magical Aptitude
Elves are among the **most naturally gifted spellcasters**.

Their magic is:
- formalized
- hereditary
- heavily regulated
- taught through institutions

Elves fear unregulated magic because it threatens continuity. Anything that permanently alters bloodlines, ecosystems, or culture is existentially dangerous to them.

### Values
Elves value:
- purity of form and purpose
- deliberate action
- preservation of knowledge
- restraint over innovation

They believe the world survives because someone is careful.

### Role in the First Age Wars
Elves were among the first affected by the Grey due to wide settlement distribution.

They:
- adapted quickly to magic
- fielded veteran commanders who fought for centuries
- served as strategic anchors in coalitions

Some elven generals fought from early Long Dimming through the War of Night.

### Elves and Tieflings
Elves distrust tieflings deeply.

Tieflings represent:
- mutable bloodlines
- external corruption
- irreversible change

Elven policies often include:
- registration requirements
- exclusion from academies
- diplomatic refusal

Elves do not see this as cruelty. They see it as stewardship.

### Second Age Outlook
Elves are increasingly alienated in the Second Age.

They view:
- human revisionism as cultural vandalism
- the Celestial Order as dangerously reductive
- magic licensing as blunt and ignorant

They withdraw diplomatically while quietly preparing for long-term instability.

## DROW

### Origin and Adaptation
Drow are elves who chose the Deep. Over centuries, isolation and scarcity shaped them into a survival-optimized society.

### Cultural Values
Drow value:
- control of resources
- hierarchy
- secrecy
- preemptive dominance

These traits are not ideological. They are environmental adaptations.

### Magical Aptitude
Drow are highly adept spellcasters, particularly in:
- shadow magic
- enchantment
- poisoncraft
- necromantic auxiliaries

Magic is a tool, not a sacred force.

### First Age Role
Drow allied pragmatically with dwarves against the Grey.
They fought relentlessly underground, particularly during Rivorn’s campaigns.

### Second Age Outlook
Drow emerge scarred, paranoid, and highly isolationist.
They remember who fought with them and who did not.

They do not forgive easily.

---

## WOOD ELVES

### Philosophy
Wood elves reject central authority entirely.

They value:
- place over bloodline
- balance over progress
- tradition through practice
- intentional forgetting

They believe rigid memory attracts catastrophe.

### Magical Aptitude
Wood elves are highly attuned to:
- druidic magic
- elemental manipulation
- ecological enchantment

They avoid spells that scar land.

### Role in the First Age
Wood elves were devastated early due to mist familiarity masking the Grey.

Once magic returned, they became some of the most effective territorial defenders, using terrain mastery and elemental specialization.

### Second Age Outlook
Wood elves become hyper-protective.
Some dedicate themselves to healing scarred regions.
They avoid global politics entirely.

---

## GOLIATHS

### Cultural Constraints
Goliaths endure rather than expand.

They accept:
- extreme environments
- high mortality
- strength through trial

They do not build states.

### Magical Aptitude
Goliaths are minimally magical.
Their power is physical, ritualistic, and environmental.

### Role in the First Age
Goliaths detected the Grey early through environmental changes.

They served as:
- chokepoint holders
- deliberate sacrifices
- last-stand defenders

### Second Age Outlook
They withdraw completely after the war.
They remain watchful.

---

## HALFLINGS

### Cultural Philosophy
Halflings reject ambition.

They value:
- safety
- trust networks
- routine
- shared risk

### Magical Aptitude
Halflings are generally weak spellcasters.

They prefer:
- minor enchantments
- charms
- ritual magic
- social leverage

### Role in the First Age
Halflings maintained:

- supply chains
- refugee movement
- morale
- cultural continuity

### Second Age Outlook
Halflings rebuild normalcy.
They preserve memory through lived experience, not doctrine.

---

## HUMANS

### Cultural Diversity
Humans are the most numerous and ideologically fragmented race.
They adapt rapidly and fracture easily.

### Magical Aptitude
Humans range widely:
- some are powerful spellcasters
- many turn to artificing
- most rely on mixed approaches

They innovate aggressively.

### Role in the First Age
Humans suffered enormous losses due to:
- fragility
- susceptibility to the Grey

They organized large standing armies.

### Second Age Outlook
Humans diverge sharply:
- traditionalists
- reformers
- opportunists

They remilitarize faster than any race.

---

## TIEFLINGS

### Origin and Ambiguity
Tieflings were created by the Old Gods but left unpurged due to fragmentation.

### Magical Aptitude
Tieflings are **extremely magical**.

They excel in:
- experimental magic
- artifact creation
- volatile enchantments
- Banned or prohibited practices such as influencing and controlling the mind. 

### Role in the First Age
Tieflings split:

- some joined Thaurûn
- others resisted
- many exploited chaos

### Second Age Outlook
Tieflings are both trusted and feared.
They adapt wherever they live.
They remember temptation.

## FINAL CANON SUMMARY

Every race survived the First Age differently.

No race emerged unscarred.  
No race remembers the war the same way.  
No race agrees on what should happen next.

That unresolved tension is the engine of Miskar going into the Second Age.
