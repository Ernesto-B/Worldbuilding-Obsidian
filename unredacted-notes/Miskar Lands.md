# The Lands of Miskar

## A Worldbuilder’s Reference to Biomes, Scars, and Surviving Places

This document describes the major biomes and region-types of Miskar as they exist after the First Age and into the Second Age. Each biome is defined not only by geography, but by **how it was shaped by the Long Dimming, the War of Night, and the presence or absence of the Grey**.

Where applicable, notes are included on how each region creates ongoing tension in the Second Age.

## Temperate Heartlands

### Overview

The temperate heartlands form the political and demographic core of Miskar. These regions consist of rolling plains, river valleys, gentle forests, and arable land. They support the largest population centers and the greatest concentration of human kingdoms, along with mixed-race cities and trade hubs.

These lands were heavily contested during the Long Dimming and the War of Night due to their strategic value. As a result, they are layered with ruins, old battlefields, and buried dead.

### First Age Role

- Primary recruitment grounds for armies.
    
- Sites of repeated advances and retreats against the Grey.
    
- Many were briefly Dimmed before being reclaimed.
    
- Magic first spread widely here after the Seal was broken.
    

### Second Age Condition

- Densely populated.
    
- Heavily governed.
    
- Most strongly influenced by the Celestial Order.
    
- Many cities are literally built over First Age graves.
    

### Narrative Tension

- The Order is strongest here, but so is historical revision.
    
- Prosperity depends on suppressing memory.
    
- Excavations routinely uncover relics the Order would rather remain buried.

## Ancient Forests

### Overview

The ancient forests are vast, old-growth regions that predate the rise of most kingdoms. They are not unified territories but layered ecosystems shaped by elven and wood elf stewardship across millennia.

These forests were never urbanized in the conventional sense. Instead, they contained **ritual sanctums, living groves, ley-anchors, and druidic sites**, spaced deliberately to avoid overexploitation.

### First Age Role

- Sites of early magical experimentation after the Seal weakened.
    
- Provided refuge and resistance against the Grey.
    
- Some sanctums were deliberately abandoned to prevent corruption from spreading.
    

### The Grey’s Impact

- The Grey did not burn the forests.
    
- It **twisted them selectively**.
    
- Some groves became wrong, growing aggressively or unnaturally.
    
- Others were isolated and preserved by sacrifice.
    

### Second Age Tension

- Wood elves believe recovery requires dispersion, forgetting, and time.
    
- Elves believe recovery requires cataloguing, guarding, and restoration.
    
- Neither philosophy can fully dominate without risking disaster.
    

These forests are places of quiet disagreement, not open war.

## The Desert of the Titans

### Overview

A vast desert composed of sand, red and orange stone, and exposed bedrock. Scattered throughout are the colossal skeletal remains of ancient Titans, constructs of the Great Gods intended as world-defenders.

These bones cast permanent shadows that create microclimates where life can persist.

### First Age Role

- Strategically vital during the Long Dimming.
    
- A major battleground due to its central location.
    
- Several Titan remains were damaged or shattered during the war.
    

### Second Age Condition

- Cities cluster beneath ribcages, skulls, and spines.
    
- Water pools in shadowed basins.
    
- Sandstorms regularly uncover or rebury ancient structures.
    

### Narrative Tension

- The Celestial Order quietly discourages excavation of Titan remains.
    
- Tiefling and human cultures here are more pragmatic and less devout.
    
- The land constantly reminds its people that even divine protectors failed.

## High Mountain Ranges

### Overview

Towering mountain chains form natural borders and barriers. They are harsh, vertical environments dominated by dwarves, goliaths, and sealed ruins from the First Age.

### First Age Role

- Dwarven fortresses became bastions of last resort.

### Second Age Condition

- Many passages are permanently sealed.
    
- Entire dwarf cities are inaccessible or presumed lost.

### Narrative Tension

- Maps are unreliable.
    
- Ancient siege weapons remain embedded in stone, unstable but intact.

## Subterranean Megastructures

An interconnected network of dwarven halls, drow cities, ancient tunnels, and deep scars in the world’s crust.

These structures are not uniform. Some are ordered and engineered. Others are organic, fungal, or chaotic.

### First Age Role

- Frontline against threats rising from the Deep.
    
- Site of Rivorn the Dread’s campaign to create the Deathless.
    
- Massive population loss underground.

- Knowledge of pre-Seal magic lingers here longer than anywhere else.

## Coastal Regions and Seas

### Overview

Coastal regions include ports, cliffs, estuaries, and tidal plains. They were among the most vulnerable areas during the Long Dimming due to limited retreat options.

The sea itself was not immune to the Grey.

### First Age Role

- Refuge routes became death traps.
    
- Fleets vanished into fog.
    
- Amphibious and flying horrors emerged during the War of Night.
    

### Second Age Condition

- Coastal cultures are pragmatic and superstitious.
    
- Shipwrecks from the First Age still wash ashore.
    
- Trade routes are vital but feared.
    

### Narrative Tension

- Some fog banks still move against the wind.
    
- Certain depths are avoided without official explanation.
    
- Mariners remember truths the Order denies.

## Island Chains and Archipelagos

### Overview

Scattered island regions survived in relative isolation. Some were bypassed by the Grey. Others endured brief but catastrophic incursions.

Floating agricultural islands, stabilized by ancient craft, support populations despite minimal landmass.

### First Age Role

- Served as refuges, observation points, or forgotten battle sites.
    
- The Grey reached some islands via air and sea.
    

### The Great Labyrinth

- One island city is built around a descending labyrinth.
    
- It predates the First Age.
    
- Its depths connect to something older than recorded history.
    

### Second Age Condition

- Relic survival is common.
    
- Cultural continuity is stronger than on the mainland.
    
- Adventurers are frequently employed to explore, map, and contain threats.
    

### Narrative Tension

- The labyrinth draws attention from multiple factions.
    
- Knowledge flows outward slowly and selectively.
    
- What lies beneath may predate both Orders and Gods.

## The Frost Lands

### Overview

Once a lush elven mountain kingdom, now a perpetually frozen range. Cold strips warmth without mercy.
