# The First Age of Miskar

## Canon Reference Document

### Scope and Intent
This document defines the First Age as the foundational era of Miskar. It explains what the world was like before magic, how the Grey emerged, how magic returned through the loosening of the Seal, and how the Age ended with the War of Night and the retreat of Thaurûn into Amon Gûl. It also defines the structural consequences that shape the Second Age.

This is not player-facing. It includes truths the public does not know.

---

## 0. Core First Age Premises

### The World’s Metaphysical Structure
- Miskar is governed by three Great Gods who currently rule the world’s cosmology and are the objects of mainstream worship.
- Beneath them exists an older divine layer, the Old Gods. Their existence and influence is later suppressed, distorted, or denied by the Celestial Order.
- Magic exists as a primal force that was sealed away by the Great Gods. The public does not know this in the First Age.
- The Seal is not simply a lock on spells. It is a binding structure that prevents something greater from returning fully. Magic usage interacts with the Seal.

### The Grey and Unmaking
- The Grey is the common name for the darkness-fog phenomenon.
- Its True or Ancient name is **Ghrathûl**.
- The Grey is a manifestation of unmaking, expressed through:
    - Atmospheric suppression of light and celestial visibility
    - Ecological decay and withering
    - Psychological erosion and madness
    - Mutation and emergence of foul beings

- The Grey’s source is dual-origin:
    - East as the visible source of spread
    - Deep as the place it rooted and grew power

### Key Named Conflicts
- **The Long Dimming / Shrouding War**: The centuries-long struggle against the Grey.
- **The War of Night**: The final decade of the First Age, 2952–2962 FA.
- The War of Night culminates around Thaurûn’s fortress-mountain, **Amon Gûl**.

### The Central Antagonists
- **Thaurûn the Starless**, an aasimar, reincarnation of one of the Great Gods, commander of the Grey’s organized hosts.
- **Vorkul the Eclipse**, a dragon empyrean of the Old Gods. The largest and greatest dragon to ever exist in Miskar.
- **Angoleth, the Shadow Grafter**, a fallen elf, a maker of warped life through the Grey.
- **Caelreth the Darkeater**, elevated and controlled by the Old Gods, loyal to Thaurûn but also a contingency against him should he fail to align with the Old God's objectives.
- **The Veiled**, seven Grey-decayed oathbound servants of Caelreth. They are past kings and champions of Miskar. Caelreth plus the seven forms a company of eight.
- **Balors**, deep-born entities allied with Thaurûn by shared hatred of sunlight rather than loyalty. Mostly unaffiliated except in the War of Night.
- Additional captains exist, including **Rivorn the Dread**, the necromancer who targets the underground realms during the War of Night.

### The Five Heroes
Five individuals become the final, defining counterforce of the First Age:
- One is an empyrean of the Great Gods who witnesses a catastrophic revelation during the final confrontation. This empyrean’s canon fate is **The Silent Exile**.
- Another becomes an Oathbreak ancestor.
- Another becomes revered but misunderstood.
- The fates of the remaining two are unknown or intentionally undocumented.
- One of the Five Heroes is dragonborn.

## 1. The Times of Light

### 0–2477 FA

### 1.1 State of the World Before the Grey
This period is defined by stability, settlement, and cultural divergence.

Important clarification: the world was not “unexplored.” The habitable world is substantially known. Trade routes, settlement zones, major mountain ranges, river basins, and coastlines are familiar to the peoples of Miskar. Unknown regions exist, but the core habitable sphere is mapped enough to support multiple civilizations.

The “mystery” of the world is not geographic ignorance. It is metaphysical ignorance. Peoples do not understand the deeper architecture of divinity, the Old Gods, or the Seal.

### 1.2 Magic Does Not Exist as a Public Force
- There is no spellcasting tradition.
- There are no arcane institutions.
- There are no widespread magical items. There may be rare anomalies or relics, but they are not recognized as part of a system.
- The world’s technological baseline is martial and craft-driven, with differences by region and environment.

### 1.3 Religion and Celestial Worship
- The sun and stars are spiritually central across cultures, especially humans.
- Clouds and storms are interpreted as hardships that pass.
- Star observation is important for navigation, agriculture, seasonal timing, and ritual.
- The later Celestial Order has conceptual roots here, but it does not yet exist as a unified global institution.

### 1.4 The Hidden Reality of the Great Gods
- The Great Gods have already displaced the Old Gods by the opening of the First Age.
- The Great Gods have already bound magic with the Seal.
- The Great Gods have already manipulated baseline perceptions across peoples, including instinctive stigma toward certain Old God-associated races, particularly dragonborn.
- This bias is present as a “natural feeling” in many hearts, not as a rational doctrine. It will later be sharpened into law and theology in the Second Age.

## 2. The First Manifestations of the Grey

### 2477 FA onward

### 2.1 How the Grey Appears
The Grey does not begin with armies... it begins with corruption of the sky and air.

Early symptoms include:
- Persistent fog banks that do not burn off
- Thick cloud cover that lingers beyond any seasonal pattern
- Stars vanishing over regions where skies should be clear
- Muted daylight that feels wrong rather than merely overcast
- Damp chill and silence that spreads ahead of visible fog
- Ecological instability in patches that later expand

The Grey is first noticed unevenly. Remote peoples and those whose survival depends on weather patterns notice it sooner. Coastal and island peoples, in particular, detect the early symptoms because navigation and tides depend on stable heavens.

### 2.2 The Grey’s Effect on the Living World
Once the Grey thickens, its impact becomes consistent.
**Ecological effects**
- Vegetation withers as if starved of more than light
- Crops fail irregularly, first in sick patches, then across regions
- Animal migration routes break
- Fish behavior shifts near coasts, then collapses

**Psychological effects**
- The Grey induces paranoia, dissociation, and despair
- Some individuals become “Dimmed” early, losing stable identity and acting as vectors for collapse
- Communities begin to fracture before open battle begins

**Monstrous effects**
- Foul creatures appear, sometimes as warped animals, sometimes as unnatural births, sometimes as things that feel imported rather than evolved
- Angoleth’s role emerges here as a “grafter” who uses Grey conditions to accelerate and direct these emergences

### 2.3 The Grey’s Mode of Spread
Canon: the Grey spreads from both East and Deep.

That means:
- Some regions experience it as a horizon phenomenon. It comes like weather.
- Some regions experience it as subterranean pressure. It rises, seeps, and breaks out.

- Island and archipelago regions can still be affected via:
    - atmospheric spread and skyborne fog masses
    - deep-sea rooting that produces abyssal surfacing events
    - later aerial host movements when high-level entities join the war

This is important because it prevents islands from being “safe refuges.” It also allows building island cultures that become early warning societies.

## 3. The Long Dimming

### 2477–2952 FA

### 3.1 The Long Dimming as a Multi-Phase War
The Long Dimming should be treated as three escalating phases.

#### Phase 1: Denial and Containment
- Nations assume it is a regional catastrophe.
- Refugee crises begin.
- Local militaries attempt normal warfare.
- Walls and forts delay the Grey’s hosts but cannot stop the Grey itself.
- Many leaders fail because they treat the Grey as an enemy army rather than an environmental and metaphysical force.

#### Phase 2: Adaptation and Fragmented Coalitions
- Cross-cultural alliances begin, often out of necessity rather than trust.
- Supply chains become decisive.
- The war becomes one of endurance, not victories.
- Some civilizations harden into fortress-states.
- Others collapse and become scavenger societies.
- Rumors of “lightless kingdoms” begin. Entire polities vanish.

#### Phase 3: The Rise of True Captains
- The Grey becomes organized.
- Thaurûn’s presence becomes undeniable.
- Named captains begin to act strategically.
- Warfare shifts from survival to existential confrontation.

### 3.2 Thaurûn’s Emergence and Amon Gûl
Thaurûn does not need to appear immediately in the narrative. His early role can be indirect.

Canonical arc:
- The Grey’s hosts feel coordinated before they are seen.
- Patterns emerge in attacks.
- Retreat corridors are cut.
- Strongholds fall in sequences that suggest intelligence.
- Amon Gûl becomes the central wound and the visible monument of the Grey’s will.

Amon Gûl becomes known as:
- a fortress-mountain
- a generator or anchor of Grey density
- a place the world cannot approach without paying a catastrophic price

### 3.3 The Pre-Magic Problem
Before magic returns, the peoples of Miskar cannot directly contest:
- the Grey’s metaphysical suppression
- the madness vector
- the unnatural transformations

They can kill hosts. They cannot end the condition that produces the hosts. This is why the world approaches collapse.

## 4. The Loosening of the Seal and the Return of Magic

### During the Long Dimming, 2520 FA

### 4.1 What Actually Happens, Canon Truth
- The Great Gods loosen the Seal because their world is being destroyed.
- This is not altruism. It is preservation.
- The Great Gods are forced to empower mortals because the alternative is the Old Gods and their chosen instruments reclaiming the world through unmaking.
- The loosening is imperfect. It may have been sabotaged or vandalized. This is intentionally ambiguous in canon for now.

### 4.2 What Mortals Experience
Magic enters the world, not just people.

That has immediate consequences:
- Ambient magical phenomena begin to occur
- Places become “charged”
- Some creatures become capable of magical effects
- The Grey gains new methods of attack

For mortals, the first experience of magic is:
- illuminating
- intimidating
- overwhelming
- familiar in a bone-deep way that is not explainable
- paired with dread, because it feels like touching something fundamental that was never meant to be handled

Magic does not “modernize” the world overnight.  
It increases the ceiling of what can be done.  
It also increases the cost of mistakes.

### 4.3 Cultural Consequences
In the First Age, there is no licensing doctrine. There is no “safe magic” theology. Nobody knows the Seal exists as a danger.

As a result:
- use is widespread where possible
- experimentation is chaotic
- heroism spikes because suddenly some can do the impossible
- catastrophe spikes because suddenly mistakes can annihilate whole units or regions

This is where the emotional theme of the First Age becomes dominant:  
**tragic ingenuity**

## 5. The Shrouding War

### Late Long Dimming phase, leading to War of Night
This is the period where the war becomes something like world-war scale.

### 5.1 The War Becomes Total
Once magic exists:
- armies reorganize around casters and enchanted equipment
- the Grey escalates with new forms
- Angoleth’s grafted horrors become more complex
- Vorkul’s interventions become possible at grand scale
- the Deep begins to manifest more directly through Balors and other abyssal forces

The world’s terrain is permanently altered... several regions are scarred from battle and the Grey. 

Examples of scar types:
- a forest petrified into white stone
- a coastline where the tide never behaves normally again
- a mountain pass that exudes permanent fog
- a battlefield where iron rusts instantly
- a valley where sound does not travel correctly

The many battles, scars, etc are intentionally not overdefined yet... leaving space for later.

### 5.2 The Grey’s Hierarchy Solidifies
By this stage, Thaurûn’s side is not a random swarm.

It has:
- captains
- logistics of horror
- deliberate terror campaigns
- strategic goals beyond slaughter

This is where Caelreth’s role as Old God-controlled contingency becomes relevant.  
Thaurûn is the commander. Caelreth is the weapon that also watches him.

The Veiled exist as the “perfect servants,” no longer independent minds.

---

## 6. The War of Night

### 2952–2962 FA

### 6.1 Why the War of Night Happens
The War of Night is the collapse of the Shrouding War into a final convergence.

Amon Gûl becomes the focal point. Both sides understand that the war cannot be “won” through attrition.

The Grey thickens globally, but the most extreme density is around Amon Gûl.

Daylight becomes unreliable. Stars disappear. The world feels trapped in an extended dusk.

This is the moment the setting becomes mythic. Not because of prophecy, but because reality itself becomes unstable.

### 6.2 What Makes It the Darkest Decade
Key features to establish:
- movement becomes impossible without light guides or magic
- supply chains collapse almost entirely
- communication breaks down
- survivors become isolated pockets
- the Grey’s madness becomes stronger
- hero figures become necessary not just for combat, but for morale and cohesion

This is when Balors appear on the surface in the only recorded mass emergence, but they do not serve Thaurûn out of loyalty. Instead, they act because:
- sunlight is suppressed
- the surface becomes temporarily tolerable
- hatred aligns them with the Old Gods’ side

### 6.3 The Siege of Amon Gûl
The final years are defined by repeated attempts to contain or strike Amon Gûl.

Creatures constantly pour out of the mountain-fortress in unending hordes of enemies, resulting in near-constant fighting by the allied peoples of Miskar... armies would have to switch out with each other every few hours or once a day to give the others a chance to rest. 

Simultaneously, missions from other directions/units were made:
Some are assaults.
Some are diversion campaigns.  
Some are last stands meant to buy time.

Important canon point:  
The mountain does not shatter.  
It is not destroyed.  
It becomes more obscured at its base by the densest Grey.

This is vital for the Second Age.
Amon Gûl is not a past event, but rather a sealed wound that still exists.

### 6.4 The Five Heroes
By the late War of Night, the Five Heroes emerge as the only viable force capable of reaching the decisive theater and surviving long enough to matter.

They will be detailed individually in another document, but for this one the important elements are:
- They face Thaurûn and his highest forces in the shadow of Amon Gûl.
- They land a lethal blow on Thaurûn.
- Thaurûn does not die. He retreats back into the fortress, deeper into the mountain’s shadow.
- The Grey condenses around Amon Gûl, becoming thicker there even as it recedes elsewhere.
- The heroes are also gravely wounded. An empyrean among them recognizes what Thaurûn is... the incarnation of one of the Great Gods. 

### 6.5 The Revelation and Its Fallout
Canonical truth:  
Thaurûn is a reincarnation of one of the Great Gods.

At least one hero realizes this at the moment of victory that is not a victory.
This fractures the moral certainty of the war, and puts into question the truth about the Great Gods.

It also sets up Second Age tension... the conflict is not just light versus dark:
It is control versus survival.  
It is theology versus truth.  
It is the world being used as a board for divine struggle.

The empyrean’s response is the Silent Exile.  
He does not lead a rebellion.  
He does not speak publicly.  
He disappears.

That disappearance becomes one of the key unhealed mysteries of the Second Age.

## 7. The End of the First Age

### After 2962 FA

### 7.1 What “Victory” Actually Means
The end of the War of Night does not purge evil.
It breaks organization.

The Grey’s hosts:
- scatter
- lose cohesion
- retreat into deep places
- fracture into smaller warbands
- become local nightmares rather than global annihilation

This is the essential distinction:  
The world is saved from immediate unmaking, but it is not cleansed.

### 7.2 The Grey’s New State
- The Grey recedes in most regions
- It becomes densest around Amon Gûl
- It slowly creeps outward over centuries in subtle ways
- This creep is often unnoticed or ignored in the Second Age because it is gradual

This preserves the grim tone.  
The threat is not gone... it is resting.

### 7.3 Magic Remains
Magic remains in the world because the Seal is not re-secured.

However:
- the public does not know that magic use weakens the Seal further
- the Celestial Crown and only a few of the highest cardinals know the cost
- the Celestial Order will later build licensing doctrine to reduce magic usage and preserve control

### 7.4 The Celestial Order’s Seed
The Celestial Order does not instantly become a global power, but the conditions for it are created:
- people crave meaning after catastrophe
- people fear magic and also rely on it
- people fear the Grey returning
- controlling knowledge becomes a political survival tool
- the Great Gods, through the Crown, can steer public doctrine

The Celestial Order preserves records with care.  
They do not burn everything; They curate and edit it. They lock truth behind hierarchy.

They do not want people to think “magic saved us.” They want people to think “order saved us.”  
Magic becomes a necessary evil, framed as a tool that must be controlled by authority.

### 7.5 The Hero Legacy Problem
The First Age ends with a paradox.
The world survived because mortals acted with magic.
But the ruling order cannot allow mortals to believe their own power is unlimited because it is not: it weakens the Seal and threatens divine control.

This tension becomes the foundation of Second Age politics, theology, and conflict.

## 9. Open Canon Questions to Keep Intentionally Unanswered (For Now)
1. Who or what sabotaged or undermined the Seal’s loosening?
2. Did the other Great Gods know the Third betrayed them?
3. Does the Celestial Crown know the identity of Thaurûn in full truth, or only the cost mechanics?
4. Where are the two unknown-fate heroes?
5. What exactly is happening inside Amon Gûl during the Second Age as the Grey thickens?
