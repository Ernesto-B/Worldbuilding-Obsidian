# Summary
- A small religious order of 6 people devoted to [[religion/the-three-pillars]] in [[regions/aetheris-isles/index|The Aetheris Isles]]. While they hold no formal political power, their spiritual influence ensures the [[factions/aetheris-isles/council-of-three]] remains aligned with the Isles' traditions and values.
- The Temple Guardians are the only ones who know the process of purifying [[world/systems/floatstone]]. They pass down this knowledge to their acolytes once they have cemented themselves to be the next Guardians.
- Every temple has one High Keeper, and a single acolyte who learns under them. 3 different temples means 6 total Temple Guardians
