# Lore
* The Floatstone Towers were constructed centuries ago, long before the modern rulers of the Aetheris Isles. Legends say they were a gift from [[religion/the-three-pillars]], imbued with divine energy to protect and sustain the Isles. Scholars debate whether the towers were built by an advanced ancient civilization or crafted by the gods themselves.
- Much of the original technology and magic used to build the towers has been lost to time. The purification process for [[world/systems/floatstone]], while highly advanced, is believed to be a fraction of the knowledge once possessed by the original creators.
- Each tower stands as a monolithic structure made of an unidentifiable white or brown stones veined with glowing lines of energy, thought to be conduits for the [[world/systems/ascension-zone]].
- The top of each tower has a massive circular platform where the purified floatstone is housed in elaborate, rune-inscribed containers. These containers are said to resonate with the energy of the Three Pillars, and together form the Ascension Zone.
- Each tower is protected by a dedicated faction, known as the [[factions/aetheris-isles/ascendant-wardens]]. These warriors, engineers, and scholars maintain and defend the towers from threats such as sabotage, corruption, and monster attacks.
- Ascendant Wardens are sworn to secrecy and forbidden from sharing their knowledge with outsiders. Only the most loyal and capable are selected to serve.
- Purified Floatstone Nexus:  The towers house massive cores of purified floatstone that create the Ascension Zone. These cores are maintained through rituals and careful engineering, requiring constant vigilance to prevent destabilization.
