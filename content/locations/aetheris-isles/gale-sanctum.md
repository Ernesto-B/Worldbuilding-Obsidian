# Description
- The Gale Sanctum, where the [[locations/aetheris-isles/stormhold]] Martial Festival takes place, is carved directly into the wind-swept cliffs overlooking the Black Tides. The open design allows the natural elements—howling winds, salt spray, and the sound of crashing waves—to immerse combatants and spectators alike in the raw power of the sea and sky.
- Massive statues of [[locations/aetheris-isles/vorynth-island|Vorynth’s]] greatest warriors, leaders, and champions are carved into the cliffs surrounding the arena. These figures are considered both protectors and reminders of the island’s martial history. Each statue holds symbolic items, such as weapons, shields, or floatstone orbs, representing their legendary deeds.
- Wind turbines and sails throughout the arena harness Vorynth’s constant gales, powering mechanisms like moving platforms, gates, and banners.
- Combatants may face dynamic challenges, such as shifting terrain, opening pits, or floating obstacles driven by the wind.
- The main battleground features a blend of solid stone and floatstone platforms. These platforms can rise and shift during battles, testing the agility and adaptability of fighters.
- The annual festival is the Sanctum’s most famous event. Fighters from all over the [[regions/aetheris-isles/index|Aetheris Isles]] (and sometimes beyond) gather to compete in tests of strength, skill, and endurance.
- Each year, the event begins with a Tide Blessing, where priests of the [[The Three Pillars#The Sea Pillar|Sea Pillar]] perform a ritual to ensure the sanctity of the battles.
- The winner of the festival is rumored to gain the favor of the [[The Three Pillars#The Sea Pillar|Sea Pillar]], in addition to being scouted for recruitment as an [[factions/aetheris-isles/ascendant-wardens|Ascendant Warden]].
- It is rumored that beneath the arena lies a hidden chamber connected to the Sea Pillar, containing relics or secrets tied to the island’s martial history. Accessing it is said to require the approval of the Sea Pillar itself.
