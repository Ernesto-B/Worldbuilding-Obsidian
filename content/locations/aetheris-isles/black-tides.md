# Description
- A treacherous sea, commonly ravaged by violent, tall waves. Due to its rough nature the Monster Purge did not reach here, and as such the majority of remaining monsters and creatures reside in the waters here.
- Although it is a dangerous sea, merchants, travelers, and adventurers have seemingly discovered safer passage from the Southern Continent to [[locations/aetheris-isles/westreach-port]]

# Location
- The sea on the South and South-West of the [[regions/aetheris-isles/index|Aetheris Isles]]. Extends to right below [[locations/aetheris-isles/vorynth-island]].
