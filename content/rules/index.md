Table standards in play at the table.

## Core Table Rules
1. **Undos**: you can change or retract anything your characters do up until the point they learn of the consequences. Once consequences are described, it’s too late to change.
2. **Dice Rolls**: Except for the DM's rolls, all dice rolls must be visible to everyone. If a die falls off the table, it is void and must be re-rolled (only the fallen die).
3. **AFK'ing**:
   - Avoid breaks during combat. If a player steps away, their character takes the Dodge action and enemies won’t target them until return.
   - AFK during non-combat: the character is “off doing their own thing.”
   - If combat starts while AFK, run without them; initiative may be rolled by someone else. They join on their next turn when back; party catches them up.
4. **Absent Players**: Please give notice. The absent character gets an in-game reason to step away. Milestone XP is shared; loot may not be.
5. **Player Responsibilities**: Know your class/abilities; narrate what you do; clearly announce attack/damage/save/check rolls with modifiers; speak up on rule errors.
6. **Virtual Sessions**: No private side-chatting. All dice must be on camera or screen-shared; unclear rolls are re-rolled digitally on share.
7. **Sensitive or Banned Topics**: If uncomfortable, stop the scene (X arms) or talk during a break/after session.
8. **Feedback and Suggestions**: After sessions, share feedback and what you’d like to explore.

## House Rules
- **Healing Potions**: Heal max value; using a potion is an Action.
- **Critical Hits**: Crit = normal roll + weapon die max (e.g., 1d8 sword → roll + 8).
- **Flanking**: Grants +2 to attack rolls (not advantage).
- **Underwater**: Breath = 1 + CON mod rounds. CON save DC 10–15; on failure lose 1 round of breath. At 0 breath, each round underwater adds one level of exhaustion.
