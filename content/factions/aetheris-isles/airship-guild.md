# Summary
* The Airship Guild is an elite organization dedicated to airship pilots, their engineers, and researchers pushing the boundaries of aerial technology. Focused solely on the creation, operation, and advancement of airship travel, this guild drives innovation in the Aetheris Isles' airborne transportation.
* Its members are considered the pinnacle of technical expertise, and airship pilots are treated as minor nobility due to their crucial role in connecting the Isles.
* Unlike the broader [[factions/aetheris-isles/ascendant-guild]], the Airship Guild is smaller and more specialized, catering exclusively to those directly involved with airship operations.
* A portion of their members are currently (as of Undead Peace) tasked with developing the means for air travel outside of the [[world/systems/ascension-zone]].
