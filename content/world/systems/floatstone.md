## Overview
An extremely valuable mineral found only in the [[regions/aetheris-isles/index|Aetheris Isles]], mined from floatstone fields and coveted across societies.

<div class="rulescard">

- Raw floatstone is light, durable, and floats inside the [[world/systems/ascension-zone]] when sufficient material is present.
- Purified floatstone does not float but can expand the Ascension Zone.
- Supply is limited and expensive, accessible mainly to middle-class Aetherists and above.
- Commercial purification is banned by [[Kingdom of Drakonia|Drakonia]] and [[Grand Republic of Silveid|Silveid]].

## How It Works
- Floatstone's natural state is to float; even outside the Isles. Floatstone can only be found in the Isles, and export of it is super controlled by the [[council-of-three|Council of Three]], thus making it a rare and expensive ore to the rest of the world. 
- Pure floatstone is extremely durable yet malleable while hot, suited to gear and tools rather than weapon edges. It is a steel-like material that is both durable and with a distinct luster, making it highly sought after as a luxury item in other parts of [[Miskar]].
- [[floatstone-towers|Floatstone Towers]] (entirely made of purified floatstone) have been there since ancient times, and it is not known why they exist or what function they have... at least publicly.
- The purification process is held by only a few elite figures; its transmission remains opaque.

## Rules & Constraints
- Limited quantity as well as export control keeps prices high and availability restricted.

## Impact on Society
- Economy: Drives trade monopolies and black-market demand for purified weapons.
- Warfare: Floatstone-based gear enables aerial tactics. This technology is in the beginnings of its invention in the year 700 [[second-age| Second Age (SA)]].

## Dangers & Consequences
- Illicit purification risks political retaliation and destabilization of politics.
