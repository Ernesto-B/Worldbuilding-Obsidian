# Lore
* The area encircled by the [[locations/aetheris-isles/floatstone-towers]] in the [[regions/aetheris-isles/index|Aetheris Isles]].
* Within the Ascension Zone, unpurified [[world/systems/floatstone]] rises naturally, creating a safe haven for sky farms, floating bastions, and airship docks. The field is self-regulating but requires periodic recalibration by skilled engineers and scholars.
