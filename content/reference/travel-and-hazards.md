- Sea: [[locations/aetheris-isles/black-tides|Black Tides]] demand escorts; most safe crossings stage via [[locations/aetheris-isles/westreach-port|Westreach Port]].
- Air: Ascension corridors around [[locations/aetheris-isles/floatstone-towers|Floatstone Towers]]; sky guards watch for sabotage and pirates.
- Vertical Transit: [[locations/iyresa/stonefall|Stonefall]] platform elevators gate movement between hollows.
- Overland: [[locations/iyresa/iyresan-plains|Iyresan Plains]] host bandits and monsters; routes skirt toward [[locations/iyresa/cindral-mountains|Cindral Mountains]] passes.
- Urban Hazards: [[factions/iyresa/black-basin-syndicate|Black Basin Syndicate]] influence in lower hollows; customs checks on floatstone leaving the Isles.
