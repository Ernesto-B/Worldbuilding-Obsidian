## At a Glance
- Twin cities Cascadea (luxury) and Stonefall (grit) anchor trade.
- Neutral on paper; guild and crime politics thrive in drifts and hollows.
- Ports and plains link caravans inland; guarded lifts gate vertical movement.

## What Adventurers Notice First
Lantern-lit canals, checkpointed elevators, and layered hollows are immediately obvious.
