![[Zorra - npc.jpg]]
# Appearance & Personality
- Human, wavy brown hair.
- Confident and powerful air that makes onlookers second guess their interactions with her. Not intimidating, but powerful aura.
- 

# Character Details
- Daughter of [[Sven Stormhold]], representative of [[Stormhold]] City in the [[Council of Three]].
- Acquaintance of [[Cpt. Vincent]]. 

# Story Details
- Zorra is trying to gain her father's trust by being personally involved in reclaiming the [[Weather Jewel]] that was stolen from the Council. According to them, the pirates must have it and must be the ones that caused the storm (not true.. it is the dragon). 

## Who She Is
- Idealistic, observant, morally grounded
- Competent but politically untested
- Believes power must be accountable
- Measures success by outcomes AND principles

## Why She Does Not Trust the Council Narrative
- Pirate explanation feels too convenient... what about the [[Ascendant Wardens]]?
- The urgency feels managed, not natural
- Her father deflects instead of answers

## Why She Volunteered for the Quest
- Suspects the Weather Jewel is central to the truth
- Knows her father cannot openly oppose her involvement
- Believes retrieving the Jewel herself will:
    - Force transparency
    - Break the false narrative
    - Give her moral leverage
- Sees the mission as:
    - A test
    - A reckoning
    - A point of no return

## How She Views the Weather Jewel
- Symbol of buried truth
- Power without consent
- A danger the Council refuses to confront honestly



# The Weather Jewel — History
## First Use — The Stormhold Near-Collapse (Justifiable Sin)
### Event
- Years ago, Stormhold faced imminent destruction due to:
    - A major Underground Labyrinth breach
    - Structural instability beneath the city
    - Floatstone Tower stress threatening collapse
- Temple Guardians warned Stormhold had **hours**, not days.
- Evacuation was impossible without catastrophic loss of life.

### Decision
- Zorra’s father secretly authorized use of the Weather Jewel.
- The Jewel was used to:
    - Arrest atmospheric pressure
    - Stabilize winds and seismic stress
    - Lock the environment into an unnatural equilibrium

### Outcome
- Stormhold survived.
- Casualties were minimized.
- The event was officially recorded as:
    - “Structural resilience”
    - “Temple intervention”
    - “Fortuitous weather stabilization”

### Hidden Consequence
- The Jewel anchored environmental instability into the region.
- Natural weather patterns never fully recovered.
- The land and sea became _sensitive_ to further manipulation.

### Father’s Internal Justification
- “I saved a city.”
- “There was no other choice.”
- “One secret is worth ten thousand lives.”

## Second Use — The Pirate Unification Event (Unforgivable Sin)
### Context
- Pirate factions were escalating raids across the Isles.
- Trade routes were collapsing.
- Sky Guard Corps coverage was stretched thin.
- The Council was deadlocked and ineffective.

### Decision
- Zorra’s father authorized a second, strategic use of the Weather Jewel.
- Goal:
    - Create a massive, hostile storm zone
    - Force pirate factions into a single region
    - Make them easier to eliminate

### Expectation
- Pirates would turn on each other.
- The Council would strike decisively.
- Stability would return.

### Actual Outcome
- The already-weakened environment fractured.
- A young blue dragon was drawn to the storm’s power.
- Pirates unified under a stronger master.
- The Great Storm became semi-permanent and began expanding.

### Why This Was Buried
- This was not desperation — it was calculation.
- Admitting this means:
    - The Council caused the Great Storm
    - The pirate threat was engineered
    - The dragon’s rise was enabled

### Father’s Internal Rationalization
- “Chaos needed a center.”
- “I misjudged the scale, not the necessity.”    
- “Admitting this would doom the Isles.”
